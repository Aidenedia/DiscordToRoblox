# DiscordToRoblox
I wrote a discord bot and flask server which gets input from a discord server and looks for the commands Forward,back,left,right or jump, and if the bot finds one of these commands it sends a post command to the flask server. I made a simple move to command in roblox and a get request which gets the command sent by the discord bot, and then resets the post back to none, and then keeps waiting a second until theres a new post request.
